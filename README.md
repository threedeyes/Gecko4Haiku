# Gecko4Haiku

This repository contains patches and related materials for cross-platform building of Gecko-based applications (such as Firefox, Thunderbird, LibreWolf, Betterbird, and others) on the Haiku operating system. The project aims to address architectural and platform-specific limitations that arise when porting these applications.

The core patches in this repository are based on the work of KENZ (https://github.com/kenz-gelsoft/gecko-dev). These patches have been adapted and extended to ensure compatibility with Haiku, while maintaining alignment with upstream Gecko development.
