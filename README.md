# Gecko4Haiku

This repository contains patches and related materials for cross-platform building of Gecko-based applications (such as Firefox, Thunderbird, LibreWolf, Betterbird, and others) on the Haiku operating system. The project aims to address architectural and platform-specific limitations that arise when porting these applications.

Includes:
* Patches to fix build and runtime issues on Haiku.
* Scripts and configuration files to automate the build process.
* Documentation for setting up the development environment.
